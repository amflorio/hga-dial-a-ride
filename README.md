# 2-Layer Hierarchical Grouping Algorithm (2-HGA) for the Multi-Vehicle Dial-a-Ride Problem

## Credits
The implementation of the FESI benchmark algorithm (files `FESI.h` and `FESI.cpp`) was obtained from [github.com/BUAA-BDA/ridesharing-LMD](https://github.com/BUAA-BDA/ridesharing-LMD).

## Dependencies
The code is currently setup to use the minimum cost perfect matching algorithm by Vladimir Kolmogorov:

Kolmogorov, V. (2009). Blossom V: a new implementation of a minimum cost perfect matching algorithm. Mathematical Programming Computation, 1(1), 43-67.

For licensing reasons, the perfect matching algorithm implementation is *not* included in this repository. The implementation is freely available at [https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html).
